    "\n",
    "Four individuals need to cross a narrow bridge at night:\n",
    "- Only **two people can cross at a time**.\n",
    "- They must use a **single flashlight** to see.\n",
    "- The group has different walking speeds:\n",
    "  - Person A: 1 minute\n",
    "  - Person B: 2 minutes\n",
    "  - Person C: 5 minutes\n",
    "  - Person D: 10 minutes\n",
    "- When two people cross together, they must go at the pace of the **slower** person.\n",
    "- Someone must return with the flashlight after each crossing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "**Minimize the total time** for all four people to cross the bridge.\n",

    "## Step 1: Why This Is an Optimization Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "- We are trying to **minimize total time** – a classic optimization goal.\n",
    "- The **constraints** (bridge capacity, flashlight dependency, walking speeds) define a **feasible solution space**.\n",
    "- There are **multiple ways** to sequence the crossings**, but only one or a few that give the optimal time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this is not a linear programming problem:\n",
    "- The objective function and constraints are **not linear**; they depend on discrete events and decisions made in sequence.\n",
    "- The solution involves **min/max operations** (e.g., going at the pace of the slower person) and **path-dependent steps** (e.g., who returns the flashlight and when).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Combinatorial Optimization?\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem falls into a class called **combinatorial optimization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "Combinatorial optimization is a type of mathematical optimization where the solution involves **choosing the best combination or sequence** from a finite set of possibilities. These problems often involve:\n",
    "- **Discrete decision variables** (e.g., person A vs. person B)\n",
    "- **Permutations or combinations** (e.g., order of crossings)\n",
    "- **Logical constraints** (e.g., only two people can cross at a time)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case:\n",
    "- Each crossing decision (who goes, who returns) is one element in a sequence.\n",
    "- The total number of possible sequences is **finite but large**.\n",
    "- The goal is to find the sequence (combination of decisions) that leads to the **smallest total crossing time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of problem cannot be solved with traditional algebraic methods (like linear programming), but requires **brute-force search**, **greedy heuristics**, or **backtracking algorithms**.\n"
